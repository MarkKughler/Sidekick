Hello and welcome.
For me, Github has always been something I've gazed upon from afar. 
That item that sparkled on the book shelf that wasn't ever touched.
That point has come where now I'm feeling the urge to spike it like an American football. 

Over the years, the search for the best practice has been elusive.
At this time of writing (2023/02/22), this is an example of how I see the structure of software.
The beginnings and hopfully over time something brilliant.

My goal for this project is rather simple.
A majority of my next steps are basically a rewrite of a tool I've already built and use for my personal business.
The parent project tracks client lists and generates invoicing written out to .pdf format.
It has served me well over that last eight to ten years, but it could be better.

This is my opportunity to learn batching, CMake and Git.
Let's Go!

<h2>Getting Started Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>CMake 3.25 or newer to generate the project build files</li>
  <li>Git 2.31.1 or newer (not required, just part of my personal setup)
  <li>Windows OS</li>
</ul>

The setup has been automated to a degree and in a fairly clean fashion.
Simply run the GenerateVsProject.bat which will check for minimum required tool versions.
Automatically create a _build folder in the same directory and populate it with the necessary items depending on your build tools. 
Build it. In theroy, that's it.

Below are the milestones, if you will
<ul>
  <li><strike>Hello Console World</strike></li>
  <li>Hello Win32 World</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
